Instruction: 
The robot in the middle is the main character in this game. Click in the window to interact with the game through a keyboard. Left and right arrows allow the robot to move from left to right in a certain range and space allow the robot to jump. Left, right, and jump are the only three possible movements. The goal of the game is to avoid barriers by moving around and jump. There are two kinds of barriers: one is the shorter one with yellow and black warning texture, the robot can avoid them by either jumping over or moving away; the other is the taller one with dark-red texture, the robot can only avoid them by moving around (too tall for the robot to jump over). The barriers are generated randomly, so it is possible that the robot is super close to, or even colliding with, a barrier at the beginning. Also, please take into consideration that the body of the robot is a 3D cube that has thickness. It may take some time at first to learn what's the proper distance to initiate a jump. If the robot collides a barrier, 'HIT' will appear on the screen. Only when the body, i.e. the cube, overlaps with barrier will count as 'HIT'. The bottom 'fire', head, and arms are not considered, else it would be too difficult. Enjoy!

About the Project:
Blender: The stars are built in Blender and imported in this project.
Hierarchical Modeling: There are two major hierarchical models--one is the ground-barrier system; the other is the robot.
Lighting: There is one diractional light and one ambient light.
Texture Mapping: The ground and the borot are texture mapped. The body of the robot involves bump mapping (but might be too small to see any actualy effect).
